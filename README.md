Automatic Code Generation
-------------------------

The code generator is located [here](https://github.com/aedans/kop/blob/master/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Codegen.kt). 
Note that when adding a new generator method, you must also call 
it from build.gradle:codegen.

To increase the number of auto-generated utilities, there is a variable 
called num in build.gradle. However, you will have to build and
publish to another Maven repository to use this change.
